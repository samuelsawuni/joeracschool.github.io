        <h1><b>Welcome to Joerac School</b></h1>
        <h2> The speech made by the director of joerac</h2>
        <p>Mr chairman, fellow heads of schools, invited guests, members of the diplomatic corp, Nananom, the teaching staff, students and all other protocol observed, it is with enormous joy that I stand here today, to address this august gathering concerning the journey and the strides we have made as a school.
          Following the trailed path of Ghana’s patriarchs of education, the late Kwegyir Aggrey, Casely Hayford and Efua Sutherland, I am proud to add my ink to the script and voice to the chorus of giving the children a better future.“We shall measure our progress by the improvement in the health of our people; by the number of children in school, and by the quality of their education; by the availability of water and electricity in our towns and villages, and by the happiness which our people take in being able to manage their own affairs.” These are the spirited words off the golden tongue of the visionary, Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah.<br />
          Mr chairman, today is a glorious day and in fact a time to celebrate the achievements of our great school and also cast our nets wider for a greater catch of success in the near future.
          Once upon a time, a dream was conceived and birthed with a wealth of positive thoughts. This school was established with it's pillars predicated on good morals and the hunger for academic excellence. From inception till now, it hasn't been an easy road. 
          Mr chairman, despite a some challenges we face, we have taken huge steps to rebuild the fallen walls of education in the Kasoa/ Nyanyano province. 
          As a an emerging beacon of education in our part of the world, we still have a firm grip on the torch passed on by our forefathers and by the grace of the Almighty God, we shall continue to press on toward the goal.
          Over the years, our school has seen tremendous surge in enrollment, deepened academic excellence and sound student nurturing.
          We are on the long course of altering the narrative of the development of our future leaders in Ghana. We have maintained a 100% success rate in the BECE (Basic Education Certificate Examination). Most of our candidates have attained excellent results and have successfully enrolled in the best senior high schools in the country. 
          I wish to offer a weighty appreciation to my staff, both the teaching and supporting staff for their hardwok and unflinching support towards the progress of the school. The school body couldn't have been well structured and academically sound without you. From the head master's desk to the corridors of the academic masterminds and morally adept teachers of this school, I have nothing but profound gratitude for them. May God continue to bless you.
          Ultimately, we envision a soceity full of responsible citizens with high expertise in diverse fields all to the benefit of the nation. 
          More pointedly, this occasion sparks a glimmer of hope, and positive energy as far as the development of the nation is concerned. Each day as I walk down the corridors, I feel the tangible positive energy that fills all four corners of every classroom. 
          And like the the Bible says in ….train up a child to the way he should grow that he may not depart from it. We pledge to nurture the children by this moral code. 
          Seeing the school cadet march by, I could only lift my head up in high spirits with my heart brimmed with pride for their bravado and their act of valor and respect for the badge and motto of the school. Motto here
          To the students that won awards and got decorated for excelling in thier respective fields and categories, I doff my hat and say Ayekoo. As I've mentioned earlier, much plaudits goes to the teachers for the sound tutelage and moral guidance.
          Keep up the hard work and never despair. 
          Mr chairman, before I take my seat, I to remind the parents that our doors are always open to them for whatever discussion with respect to the growth of thier wards and the school. Together, we form a family of stakeholders and active agents of change. We will continue to be relentless in our efforts to keep the school at the summit of education. 
          Ladies and gentlemen, there comes a time, when we will be grey-haired men and women with walking sticks. This younger  generation will take up the mantle of leadership. They'll be the stalwarts of their time.
          However, untill then, We will keep blazing the torch. The torch that symbolizes the responsibility and the flames that symbolize our burning desire to carry the scholarly scrolls on our shoulders and to keep the dream alive for these future leaders. 
          Once again, Mr chairman, I thank you all  for coming over to show your support. Long live the school, long live Ghana.
          <strong>God bless you.</strong>
